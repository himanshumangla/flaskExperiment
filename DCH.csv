Let's talk LUG NUTS.  My front driver tire LUG nuts were not tightened down after leaving and being on a trip to Tahoe became really nerve wrecking when things started shaking.  We were fortunate not to become a fatality.   I tightened down the LUG nuts and took the car to the Toyota Service shop in South Lake Tahoe as a precautionary measure.   When I bring the car in for the struts repair work I also want your mechanics to check the condition of the LUG bolts on the front driver wheel and replace if damaged.  As you can tell I am not happy with the my last visit.

To replace with the same tire as what you have already on (Bridgestone Ecopia), it will be $312 for 2, $625 for 4. Goodyear Assurance: $338 for 2, $672 for for, but there is $40 mail-in rebate if replaced 4, OR with Goodyear Eagle: $280 for 2, $560 for 4. Strongly recommends to perform alignment after tire replacement. Also one other recommendation: Excessive fuel/carbon deposit build up found in throttle body/plate and fuel injection system (probably along with combustion chamber and on intake valves) starting to make your vehicle run rough and slight loss of power upon acceleration (restricting air/fuel flow). Instead of waiting until costly/time consuming hard parts replacement when failed, tech recommends Intake/Electrical fuel injection system DECARBONIZE service to dissolve/clean up fuel deposit/restriction for to help to run smoothly andto improve acceleration power for $220 ($249 reg).

I have dumped over $1500 since January and every time I pick it up it is running worse than when I brought it in. I don't know why I had to spend $400 on new hoses when that is clear to me that was not the problem why smoke was coming out of the vents. I have exactly the same problem now I had then. I know the car has a lot of miles but it is a landcruiser and they can handle a lot. Please figure it out,50201665,"sorry, i don't want to miss-lead you, just being honest about findings. I spoke with shop foreman and we are very clear on the heater core  needing replacement, the vents are merely proving a path for the smoke to get out. Back in January the hoses were leaking coolant and they were replaced, now there is  a different leak and heater core needs to be replaced. they also noted valve cover gaskets leaking oil back in January, as they get worse, it will eventually develop a burning smell getting into car through vents also.  please let me know if you decide on any repairs and i will check with Bryan and work with you.

50151096,So that is $395. What about the $400 I had to spend on the AC that was not fixing the problem,50187284,"Good morning Mr. Anderson, its Miguel at Toyota. i talked to Bryan and we looked at history, the heater is leaking coolant, not ac related, its just coming from vents because it is the only area to vent. I talked to shop foreman and if that heater core was leaking like it is today, the engine would have overheated long ago due to low coolant level so we are not sure when the leak started, the reservoir was almost empty. we are also not sure if there is any head gasket or internal damage because you mentioned the temperature gauge  did not go up so that is a good sign but with high mileage you never know.  We will gladly work with you on either repair if you decide but again, with high mileage is hard to know if anything else may be needed. if you decide to do anything, we will work on that expense you had in the beginning of year we can absorb  some of the labor cost into the repairs if you like. Again, with high miles, there may already be some pre-developed condition internally we cannot see...please let me know and Bryan or I will gladly work with you...thank you

On May 9th you sent me a similar text. I replied but did not hear back from you.  A couple days later I called in and was told by the receptionist that a service manager would call me to discuss .  I did not get a call back.  Here is a copy of my reply from 5/9/17:

Hi Margaret.  My husband just recently had the oil changed. However, we are still having issues with the horn going off at all hours of day and night.  Our neighbors are starting to get angry so we really need to get this rectified.  We are in violation of the noise ordinances.  The last time I brought it in the tech was not able to fix the problem.  Our neighbors want us to get it disconnected. I don't want them to continue to be awakened during the night nor have them turn us in to the city.  Is there a way that the panic/horn sirens can be disconnected but still allow us to use the horn if we are driving the car?  When are some options to bring in?  Please advise.

But it looks like your selling dealer Buena Park Nissan has not activated/entered the warranty info into the system; Your contract is NOT SHOWING (meaning no extended warranty is active) at this time. Some of the recommended repairs are covered components, however you MUST contact your dealership and have them enter/active the contract into the system before you can use it for claims. Honestly it looks very suspicious... but as long as they activate your claim, you are ok. Their phone# 714-739-0800, reference Deal# 188524. GIve them a call, ask how long before you can start ""using"" the contract.. RUSH them.. this isn't right (you paid $1850 for the contract that you cannot use). LEt me know Kelsie.

Do you want  us to replace it for $247? That would be the very first step, the glovebox light concern needs to be rechecked at that point. DVD concern needs more time..and the diag will be $129. (bmper to bumpter factory has expired by time..) :-(

If there's any paperworks you have for me, please have them ready. I will be there at 11:00 and can only stay till 11:30. I cannot be late to work again. Thank you. 

Kaori Sawada",36905299,"Good morning Kaori, I sincerely apologize for the service experience yesterday. The rental fee is on us, however the Extra insurance is not covered as company policy, But let me see what I can do to assist you for the rental you have purchase. Can you see if you can take a pic of enterprise Invoice and text it over to me before you get here please? I can definitetly make the insurance you purchased as our Store Credit where you can use it for future visits, but I cannot guarantee you the reimbursement.

So is Toyota implying that this is new ?",36251624,"it's not the oil leak that's cover under warranty extension, it's the updated piston replacement along with new head gasket that's covered under the warranty.

27025913,It sounds like a lot but I think each is important. Go ahead with all. I am curious on how the hybrid battery filter  can be so dirty at this point? And if I can do anything to avoid that. Also another question.  Most if not all the time I will run the ac on recirculate. Is that more of a problem for the ac evaporator?,27027536,"It is normal for Prius to collect enough debris on the filter/fan at around 45-75k miles depending on te air quality in the cabin. for example if you pets, we have seen 17000 miles completely clogged hybrid batt warming up. The hybrid batt cooling fan service is THE ONLY maintenance service available to protect your batt so I highly recommend to get it serviced. As far as AC, it's not so much in recirc mode, it's the ac moisture not drained out throughly after ac usage.. but using the ac in recirc mode will gather up more water in evaporator in general. Keeping using the AC as you prefer, just take off the ""AC BUTTON"" 15-30 sec before the engine is shut off/parked. I will let techs know to move forward with the recommended service.. it will be ready at around 11:30-12pm. Do you want me to give you a lift home or another loaner vehicle till later on today?

So I just assumed they skipped the last step as it was late on Saturday. I though about trying to do it myself but I did not know if there was a special procedure. I read the bottle and it stated to do so into the intake. So I decided to ask the counter. She recommended we just send you a message since she had nobody around to ask. I would like to use it since the odor was pretty bad at its worse. It's better now but I keep thinking I smell a little from time to time.
