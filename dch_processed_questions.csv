Question
What is the latest I can come today
I can bring it in on Monday afternoon. How long will the service take because I might have to wait for it?
I'm leaving town this eve. Really need it. I wonder if something happened to it when your employee drove it that 47 miles without myauthorization
Why wouldn't I be able to patch it?
Any idea of when part arrives ?
Maybe something happened when you guys drove 47 miles

Ok. What is all that going to cost?  Going broke on this car!
What did they say about the passengers seat. I thought it was getting fixed. Looks like nothing is done
Hi Margaret.  Do you know when the shuttle will pick me up?
I will be there at 1130. My tpms light flashes which indicates a fault. And it hugely annoying. So I need to know exactly which tire is cussing the problem. However I am not going to pay 120 per tire to fix that light . I need oil change as well. Jd. Have a shuttle bring me home please. Thanks
The car should be ready in an hour.  How about 11:00 a.m.?
Hi about how much longer?
How much are rear rotors by themselves
"Thanks Miguel this is Nery I noticed when I pick my car up it had 116 miles on it after I charged it myself and only charge up to 91 miles is there something I can do to get me closer to that 116, or is that indicative of the same problem? Thank you"
"I see it, just tell them to pick it up and call me when they are at the gate"
"I can drop it off in the morning, what am I looking for?"
Hi Deanna! What are those recommended services that were not completed?
Who is this and where r u calling from?

 Hi Daniel - I wasn't  aware of any other services that my car needed - can U please let know what it is ?

How long will that take do you think? 
What time can I pick it up tomorrow

Yeah. How much will this be
"Oh ... so if in your opinion he did, than what do you think it cost the loosen of the screw ?"

What service is it due for?
Thanks for the information. I'll get in there when I have some free time. Have a great week!
"It has only happened recently- maybe 3 times in total. What happens is that it will eventually blow out cold air, but not until about 10-15 minutes into thedrive. It could totally just be a side-effect of it being so hot recently."
Ok what time can I pick it up in the am? 
I was wondering how long will it be until my car is finished
1) can we reduce it to a total cost of $210?  And 2) how long would I have to wait?
What is the cost w/o the discount? What is the exact work to be performed on my car's fuel system?
How is 9 am

My husband will walk over and pick up the car when he gets off of work this afternoon. Please let me know the total charge for today with discount applied. Thank you for your assistance. I wish you a wonderful day.
Yes. Please do the preventive injector service for $249.95 and the line flush for $159.95. How long ago were the brakes done? Why is the brake fluid dark and needing change so soon?

Hi Chrissy. How long will the tire replacement take?

Richard it's Fred the vibration starts when you put it in reverse. With the a.c on.

What will be the total? With everything included?
Thanks.  Do you know when my servicing period expires?
How about 8/11 at 11 am?
"Do you have a time available 8/11?  Is there a time when I could either get the work done when I take the car in and not have much of a wait--or when I wouldn't have much of a wait to get a ride home?  If not the 11th, maybe the 18th?  Thanks!"
What time are you open until?

Do you know u have an idea of when someone will be here? Been waiting for awhile...
Ok thanks what time do you close?
So what would be the total?
Miguel I appreciate all of your effort.  I know this has been a pain for you as well.  Please let me know when we would be able to pick up the vehicle. It may be later today since my wife is already out and about. Thank you again for your help here
What time do you close today? Can I come to get my cat around 5 PM?
Yes. Please do them.  When will my car be done?
What is this fee For? You told my husband yesterday there would be no fee for this 
"Miguel I know you are doing your job and doing your best. However you an I both know that this situation has not been handled properly.  I am not mentioning a legal action, I am establishing I know my rights and encouraging you guys to do the right thing.  I am a business owner, if my customer is having a problem based on something that is my fault or the fault of one of my partners I eat it as part of good customer service. If a customer has a problem and I am a manager and the customer asks to speak to me and I ignore the calls and never get back in contact with the person, how exactly do you think that will translate. The mark is being missed with basic customer service. I know for a fact I am not being a jerk or unreasonable. I have not come down there yelling and going off. I have been very respectful. Again I am just encouraging the right action to be taken. That's all"
"Hello Richard, may I know when it can be done?"
Also I expect an explanation from your manager as to why he ignored my calls while you were away. He never called me back. I find that interesting as well. I know executives at corporate from when I worked there who have migrated to Plano Texas. I am making calls myself. I am really interested in how this situation plays out. I am documenting this.

"Ok. I am leaving town this weekend on business but my wife pick it up when it is ready. However I have many questions and concerns about this vehicle and Toyotas ability to support maintenance.  I also am confused about why a large dealership, and corporation like Toyota (who I used to work for out of their corporate office in Torrance) is squabbling about some rental car fees when legally that is not my responsibility as the consumer. I find that confusing. I will be around Saturday and then I leave town on business. I will be accompanying my wife. I just want you to know I will have questions"

"Hi Janet,Thank you.  I will pay at the cashier when I arrive."
Hey Miguel that's just my boy looking out for me. Thanks for going to bat for me. And I wouldn't want you to take your day off to go to court for me so that's why I allowed him to ask you to do even more work.
Just replace the battery for now. In September I will have the struts and recall done when I get the engine oil changed. Thank you. 
"Miguel, please call me when you get a second so I understand the total of the service.  Thanks"
Will this delay when the car will be ready?
Do you have a record of when they were last replaced?
"Richard, the extended warranty is through century; phone # 877-793-7123, contract #4S219940. Bought the vehicle from Elmore Toyota. The skid control ECU was replaced by Elmore when vehicle was purchased last year."
Terrific!   Thank you!   How late can I come for pick up?
Thank you. Will they let me know when they are on their way?
What car are you talking about?
What is the latest I can pick it up
One more question.... How long do you think it'll take for the service? I'm trying to arrange appointments with customers after service. Thank you
Hi Chrissy. I have a Toyota Motor Corp. lease Highlander that I need to bring in for a basic service. Can I drop it off tomorrow morning when I pick up the Prius?
"Yes please. Now If I want to use full synthetic oil instead of conventional,  how much would I have to pay?"
What would be the latest appointment you take on Saturday afternoon? 
how much would the service cost?
Thanks - approx how much longer?
"Hi Jose. It's William Hill with the Toyota Highlander. The one that needs the drivers side window seal replaced.  I'm looking to come in next Thursday Aug 3rd at 9:15am and get it fixed along with getting the service that just came due. Also I believe there is a recall on the back hatch of some sort...regardless, mine sometimes makes a bad squeaking sound when opening or closing. I'm going to call and make an appointment but I wanted to let you know in case the window seal"
So total price for everything with taxes and what not is 1550ish?
Hmm when do I need to tell you? I'm just surprised the seal is going bad below 60k miles
Ok ty so much..what is my total damage? 
Did they say how bad the leak for the water pump is? No performance issues with pump? Can't patch? 
How late can she pick it up?
Thanks Marvin for servicing my Van. Just wondering what type of oil did you used? Thanks

I would like to reschedule but want to order a license plate holder for the FRONT BUMPER of my 2009 Camry hybrid and have it installed at my service appointment. When should I make the service appointment to be sure the holder will be in? Diane Rippere 623-826-1105. Thank you."
I just talked to your guy and he says you'll still be able to see it when he's done.
Good morning Jose.  I went to pay my invoice online and it said to pay $1551 but then at the bottom off the detailed invoice it said extended warranty to pay $900. Can you just please tell me the amount I will have to pay when I get there in a bit.  Thanks Tim 2000 solara

"Marvin, picked car up tonight and the alignment seems to be off. Car is going to the left when keeping steering wheel straight. Was the alignment redone after they put the new struts on? Also, noticed on paperwork that color of car is gold. It should be silver. Thanks, Jana Roche"
Ok. Thank you for letting me know. Is there an approximate time when it'll be done tomorrow? I ask because I work until 7pm. Would I be able to pick it up after that?
Thank you. Let me check what time I will need the shuttle for.

"Good morning Margaret, thank you very much for helping me out yesterday. I did end up leasing another car from your facility after we spoke. Please let me know when I can come and recover my belongings. Thank you"
What will my total be
Are there anything else has to be serviced other than the regular maintenance?When will the car be ready?
Hi Diana. Can you call me when you get a chance. I want to talk about my service. 
Are you turning front rotors and what is the percentage of the brake pads left currently?
"Thanks Marvin. So, you believe the struts were defective which was still causing the noise. Is that correct? Thanks, Jana"
And how much more time will it take to get them done?
When AAA checked they believed issue is more than battery - perhaps the equivalent of an alternator in a Prius that charges battery ... I've only had car about 3.5 years - purchased new ... can you confirm it's just a battery issue - in January 2017 - I had same issue ... I was gone for over a week and my battery was dead and had to be jumped ... last night AAA advised battery failed but I took to dealership because the issue was thought to be alternator equivalent too
How about 7/29?
Thank you but I had my oil changed with my local mechanic who also did a safety inspection. When major mechanical scheduled maintenance is due please let me know.
Why would I owe money since my car is totaled?
Ok with the breaks only I can't return the car to you because I had to leave a deposit which will be return when the car is

What service is due?
Thanks Deanna but I already serviced my Toyota with Carson Toyota they gave me a coupon like what DCH gave me . 
"I reset my trip on my odometer every time I fill up, I monitor it very carefully. And this car, a Prius, not even getting a full 200 miles on a full tank doesn't seem right at all..? It used to get around 320. I'm slow, my ac has always been used, no change in my ac useage or how fast I accelerate or drive. So it worries me a lot and I'm really confused about this."
"I've always had my ac running. Always. I've always averaged around 47-50 mpg. It's gotten 33 as of late; I don't even get 200 mpg on a full tank anymore. I keep it in the green on my eco meter, I drive slow. So it's hard to understand why my car is now getting 33 miles per gallon when nothing in my driving has changed."

How is the tundra
When should I bring my car in today?
Ok thank you.  Where do I pick it up? 
Any idea how much longer for my car?  Doreen
I am here at Toyota now. How much longer do you think. Doreen
Good morning Miguel. 1-800-621-2130 is the Warranty group under my  ber Xchange Lease. Mr. Lopez documented what happened and requested you to call him regarding my situation. He is aware the engine is on order. I stand ready to pay for the engine in full until this situation can be resolved and appreciate all your help- Thanks Tom Indig
I am trying to wrap my head around how this is now my responsibility to resolve when I am not at fault or responsible
I am trying to wrap my head around how this is now my responsibility to resolve when I am not at fault or responsible
I don't understand how this is possible
"Deanna,Let's talk LUG NUTS.  My front driver tire LUG nuts were not tightened down after leaving and being on a trip to Tahoe became really nerve wrecking when things started shaking.  We were fortunate not to become a fatality.   I tightened down the LUG nuts and took the car to the Toyota Service shop in South Lake Tahoe as a precautionary measure.   When I bring the car in for the struts repair work I also want your mechanics to check the condition of the LUG bolts on the front driver wheel and replace if damaged.  As you can tell I am not happy with the my last visit.Dave Koscielniak "
Good morning. Is this what you need?
HeyHow are youI came today to service my car but you were not there and I left. Will you be in on Monday for me to come and do it.
I actually work got toyota corp. told my wife to go in for nail in tire. You said it was in the wall and not in tread. Had our facility look at it and of course it was in the tread and we had them plug it. $220 for a tire that was repairable. How will you respond now?
"Great, how do I request a shuttle to pick me up?"
"That's ALOT of $ for a 2005 car!  And we just bought a new car, so our budget is very tight - & we can't afford another new car now. If you can do it all for $500, which is a lot more than the $39 I had planned, we will go ahead."
We have to leave for a wedding in Los Angeles in 2 hours so today isn't good for you or me. Monday I have to be at work  by 7:30 so if I can stop by at 7:00 AM could Juan possibly try to reset the computer again  before I have to go to work? I am wondering why this keeps happening.
What about the tire?
 How long will that take
"Ok. So when I bring it in to remove panels, will I be charged only for the repair if there is one?"
What are rear brakes at?
"Hi. Sorry, I was away from my phone. Thank you! I should be there to pick up my car within an hour or so. Did the tech say what the issue might be? Or an estimate of how much it will cost to fix?"
"Hi. Sorry, I was away from my phone. Thank you! I should be there to pick up my car within an hour or so. Did the tech say what the issue might be? Or an estimate of how much it will cost to fix?"
I have a question about the brakes.  They measured 6mm in January.  What are they at now?
"Hi Marvin, what is your major maintainable promotion? Are there all included in major. M?"
"Ok, I should be there between 11:30-12:00 I will call you when I'm on my way"
"Hi Jose, Do you have an ETA for when the car will be done. It has been about 3 hrs"
"Hi Marvin, Can you tell me what total price is?"
do you have an ETA on when my truck will be done?
"One thing though... I've been complaining about lower than expected mileage since my 5,000 mile checkup but they've never been able to figure out why. They suggested it was driving conditions, etc., but I'm wondering if crud was starting to build up back then? At any rate, it'll be nice to have it running as it should."
How are we doing with time?
"Hi Margaret, FYI - I'll want to replace all four tires but would like to see what pricing looks like first. Thanks!"
Sydney can you please actually change the oil even though it's not due. Can you also have them check the front windows as they screech when going up and down. Thx.
"Approximately, what are we looking at ?"
Jose how much would the repairs would be ?
How long would that take ?
"Hi Jose, I am fairly certain I lefty prescription eye glasses on the passenger seat when I left the car their Friday 7/21. They ere black thin metal. They may be in a black plastic Coctco case. I would appreciate if you check with the mechanic and any likely lost & found locations. Thank you"
How much would the leak test be ?
Hi Miguel. I have to say I was disappointed when I saw some stains in the passenger seat but when I saw the two nicks on my drivers side door I was even more disappointed in the way I received our vehicle back.
"Hi Deanna, How about Tuesday morning?"
"Hello , thank you for reminding. How about August 1 st , Tuesday . first in the morning ? If anything available. Please let me know . Thank you ."
Great. Could u have someone pick me up ???  What time and I will be waiting out front.

Thanks Diana. I'm in Northern California for now and won't be in SoCal until September or October. When I have my return date worked out  I'll schedule something.

"Please let me know when it is ready, I will be at the lobby "

The more I think about your text the more I wonder about it. I can understand shopping around for new car prices but never heard about anyone negotiating car repairs.

It's 'dead' - we just had a battery changed - don't understand why it won't open the door, start the engine, etc. I will call AAA again tomorrow and will bring the car in to Toyota. I am quite upset as I wasn't expecting this problem since we just had the battery replaced. Please expect me tomorrow. Thank you. Have a good afternoon. "

Hello is this for the breaks? How much will you charge me?
Awesome.  How late are you guys there? 
Good morning margaret.....how are things looking?
You guys are very ambiguous diagnosing the problem with my car. It should be more black and white what is wrong. It's not going to be an opportunity for you guys to just keep charging me as you explore thru the engine. I have dumped over $1500 since January and every time I pick it up it is running worse than when I brought it in. I don't know why I had to spend $400 on new hoses when that is clear to me that was not the problem why smoke was coming out of the vents. I have exactly the same problem now I had then. I know the car has a lot of miles but it is a landcruiser and they can handle a lot. Please figure it out

Could someone please look at the discoloration on the right side of the back bumper that is above the exhaust pipe? Also we noticed that there looks to be some pin hole rust marks on the roof.

Also, the car is now idling much louder and rougher than before. I did not anticipate the suspension repair having this effect on my cars performance, like this.

"Hi Margaret,On May 9th you sent me a similar text. I replied but did not hear back from you.  A couple days later I called in and was told by the receptionist that a service manager would call me to discuss .  I did not get a call back.  Here is a copy of my reply from 5/9/17:Hi Margaret.  My husband just recently had the oil changed. However, we are still having issues with the horn going off at all hours of day and night.  Our neighbors are starting to get angry so we really need to get this rectified.  We are in violation of the noise ordinances.  The last time I brought it in the tech was not able to fix the problem.  Our neighbors want us to get it disconnected. I don't want them to continue to be awakened during the night nor have them turn us in to the city.  Is there a way that the panic/horn sirens can be disconnected but still allow us to use the horn if we are driving the car?  When are some options to bring in?  Please advise.  Mi Steburg"

"Hi Jose. I checked in my glove compartment and I did indeed have an extended warranty that expired on March 31, 2017. Since this problem with the light clearly existed already at my previous service when you put in new bulbs, I firmly believe that this warranty should cover the last repair. I would even say that the problem I had pointed out at service previous to my last one was not properly diagnosed and just cosmetically fixed with new bulbs without trying to find out the reason for the problem. So I would appreciate it if you could negotiate this for me and hopefully send me some good news next weeks. Thanks."

"I was very happy with your service but a bit annoyed when trying to make my payment. I used a credit card I know had a zero balance and should have processed with no problem, but it was declined. Worried about why I just decided to use my debit card knowing I had plenty of cash in my checking account. It was declined as well.  I immediately checked my account to make sure there were no fraud alerts or to make sure no one stole my money. I had plenty of money in that account. I asked the cashier to retry since it should not have declined. She tried it the third time and it went through fine. The reason. I'm complaining is i would have preferred to use my credit card for the points. So not sure if it was user error or a machine problem. Can you have someone in your management research and determine what the problem was with your credit card processing machine? Thanks, Suzanne"

How late would you be able to take care of it this afternoon?

"I've also explained to the service personnel 3 weeks ago that it wasn't battery since road side assistance said, that the battery was fine and it was technical. Yet, TOYOTA had me pay for a new battery which was not necessary. The battery is NOT the issue."
Why is the battery keep being tested when it's new? 
Why is the battery keep being tested when it's new? 
So is the battery being drained? Because I don't understand why it won't start.  Will your techs continue to work on it or are you saying for me to pick it up?
How can leaving the key in the car cause this problem? I strongly emphasize that the keys are never left in the car. 
Can u please check to see if my maintenance coverage is good through 100k.  That is what I thought I purchased when I bought the car in 2012.

Not sure if the intake is cracked or what the problem is? 
*when I take my foot off the gas
It stalls after driving it 30min at stop lights when the engine is warm. That's  what was the problem if he drives it for 10min around the block it's good but after 30min or so it sputters out when I take my foot off the break and it idles low then dies.

For .. how May miles
How long would the new ones stay
"Miguel - this is Wayne Goodman again. I appreciate your patience with me today. I picked up the car and it seems to be working fine. I have one additional question. When I picked up the car, I did not see the discount documented for the cost of the tax, which you said was nearly $300. The woman helping told me the part cost was about $3,300 (verified with the parts department) and the price you charged to me was $3,104. Thus, you only discounted me $200, not $300. I would like a $100 credit back to my credit card."

Thanks. I'll let you know by the end of the day what to do.
Thank you so much  can you send me the shutter to the same address where they drop me off this morning please!
Then why were you contacting me? I paid about $500 for my services didn't I?
How can you prove that?
I would like a refund on the discounted amount compared to what I paid for or I will be taking my service on both Prius's elsewhere.
It was never mentioned.  Why is that?  The cleaned the fuel injectors or claimed they did.  What's up with that Deanna?
I had everything performed on the car that Jose the service manager recommended.  What are you referring to?
Thanks Michael--Yes please text me when you get the 2 replacement grey trim panels that got damaged by the body shop.  I'll come in right away.  Thx!

Dropped off car today for damage repair. Was a bit disappointed that I did not get a response back and after originally making appt through you how things are handled. Yes I needed tires for my RAV but will get them elsewhere as well as future work. I have spent a bit there and you were accommodating at the time as you provided a loaner and explained things. Things were not done right as a customer should expect.
What is the latest I can pick up today ? Amount due or Free? 
Why is it when we only press on brakes or let off?

"Hello richard, about how much longer do you think it will take for my car to be ready? I only ask because I usually leave for my class soon"
"Rough estimate when I can pick it up? I need to arrange for a ride. I live about 10 miles away, so outside of your normal shuttle distance"
"Daniel, I understand. I am asking for two things in particular. First, Joel Alarcon's business card attached to the service paperwork. Second, a telephone number and/or any other information that DCH Toyota and/or Toyota Corporation provides to customers to facilitate the process of replacing the tire. Don't worry Daniel. You and Bryan have been professional and polite. However, I feel the decision the dealership has made is shortsighted.  I purchased my first Toyota,  a Celica hatchback from the dealership when it was Whittlesy. Since that time we have had our Sienna, 4-Runner, and Tacoma serviced at the dealership."
Will you let me know when the truck is done?
Ok what time are you in tomorrow

Let me know when the car is ready please
How do these fuel deposits occur? Is it just something that happens with time or is their a way to prevent it?

That's all I ever heard was""We will get back to you!"" and now my warranty has expired. This issue could have been resolved back when I had my warranty but due to the Service tech negligence nothing was done.  Please get back to me today. I need to know how this issue be resolve.

"Margaret, thank you for the update. Before I get excited & arrange to bring the car in, would you have someone test it out to be sure it is operating properly(both AM/FM & the CD player. Remember last time we thought it was fixed, it didn't work, so I want to be sure before I get my hopes up. Let me know when you have some assurance it's a go.  Jeff Carlton"
How long do you expect til completion?
What time you close today?
If you have schematics/drawings of the trunk and hinge assemblies I would like to see when I come in to identify what else is missing.
If you have schematics/drawings of the trunk and hinge assemblies I would like to see when I come in to identify what else is missing.
Also discovered under the license frame that the rubber pads under the frame on the trunk were not reinstalled after the repair which prevents the frame from scratching the trunk body.
Also where the hinges were installed is peeling apart and not painted.  See pictures.
Also on the rear trunk door underside there are some holes where some trim was not installed back?  See picture below
I just picked up my car and found several keyed scratches on my vehicle on the passenger front panel side above wheel we'll and on the driver side door and driver side passenger door.  I showed it to your Toyota representative and she confirmed that this should be bugged out by your detailing crew.  I did not have these damages when I dropped off my car at your dealership.  Attaching pictures.   Please call me to arrange repair.  The rep said she was leaving the paperwork with you.
K great. How late are you open
What are your hours tomorrow?
Done? As in my car is fixed? Or as in you know what is wrong with it?

"Hi, Mr. Hernandez, just wondering when the dashboard for my Sienna will come in? Thank you."
"I want to come in next Mon. (5-15) at 7am for regular service & cabin and engine air filters. It depends on the total cost. Do I need to print out the coupon for 15% off? And the routine service...how much total? I do not need the tires checked or rotated.Can you tell me?Thank-you so much."
How much would it cost to change the hv blower motor system or was that already fixed this time?
"Margaret, thanks for the fast service. I think I can replace the bulb in the taillight. I want to look at the head gasket on my own first. What is the latest I can pick up the car. What is the final bill without the other work. Once again thank you"
"Don't worry Daniel. You and Bryan have been professional and polite. However, I feel the decision the dealership has made is shortsighted.

How about Monday the 15th at 9 AM? You're the best!!!
Ok call me tomorrow when the car is done thank you 
I have a question about door actuators. Years ago during service one of your colleagues quoted approx $1200 to replace (and mentioned the repair possibly being covered). I was surprised at the cost and asked if that was per door (and what regarding coverage). I never got an answer but I let it go and I've been using my key ever since. Driving the Prius reminded me of this issue.
"And since toyota is providing a loaner car, can you tell me about how long it may take? I.ask to make sure i can get to work on time. Thanks."
"Hi marvin this is rosy mondragon.  I will b dropping my car off tomo5 morning, how early can i b there, 7am?"

Thank you I appreciate the reply and concern! What time is a good time ?
Margaret. Can you give me a call when you get a chance. Thanks. 
Yes. I'm just not sure when
"Do 1,2 and 3. I'll replace the tire elsewhere. About how long a wait?"
Ok that's what I thought thank you so much Jose
How about 11:15. Thank you so much!
Hi Daniel.  This is Jeanne Leonardi re: the Toyota Camry with the defective tire. I am planning on picking up the Camry. I need the name of the manager making the final decision on not replacing the tire. You stated that defects need to go through the manufacturer.

"Hi Margaret.  My husband just recently had the oil changed. However, we are still having issues with the horn going off at all hours of day and night.  Our neighbors are starting to get angry so we really need to get this rectified.  We are in violation of the noise ordinances.  The last time I brought it in the tech was not able to fix the problem.  Our neighbors want us to get it disconnected. I don't want them to continue to be awakened during the night nor have them turn us in to the city.  Is there a way that the panic/horn sirens can be disconnected but still allow us to use the horn if we are driving the car?  When are some options to bring in?  Please advise.  "

That is something I don't have to get fixed today, maybe another time for the tire pressure, but can the rear driver tire get re-balance, I'm pretty sure the speed balance on that is off because the shaking when you hit 70+mph began after that rear rim was replaced and the shop who swapped the rims didn't do it correctly. Please let me know that you got this text."

When I am pulling my trailer I literally have to decide whether to be on the brakes or go over the bump first if I do both it's scary

Hi Margaret... any idea when the Sequoia will be ready?

Okay what time the service department closesMy parents are my ride to DCH and I believe they will be home from work around 5PM or 6PM
How long does the road test take
As I said before I am out of the country I will call when I get back. I have 2 cars so I am not driving it right now anyway.
You did not understand what I was saying my spot is at 8 am today Tuesday but I am checking if u have he parts to repair FIRST: rear bumper and parts and rear view camera and parts?????
Hi. I think there has been a misunderstanding. When I made this appointment I asked only for an oil change not for a full service
"Ms. Carlin, I'm on the road right now and do not expect to be back for some time. My mileage is well below the recommendation for service right now but I expect that it will be at that level by the time I'm done here. Let me figure out when I will be back and I'll schedule service then. No need to keep messaging me, I'll get back to you soon."
How about 8:30 this Friday? And I would also like to leave it for a full inspection.  Does NOT need an oil change.
I've only put 800 miles on it since last time I was in. That's why I didn't respond last time u contacted me. I will change the oil and will be back in when it's needed! Thank you.

How long does the service take?
"Was not aware... but we replaced them because the car was noisy, rough and handling REALLY badly, especially when going around corners, over bumps, and changing lanes. Also, the car was involved in two different fender benders and the cover on one of them was cracked. We weren t sure if it happened in the accident so just went ahead and replaced it."
Have you check when the a shuttle will be ready

Do you know how much this whole thing will cost me?
Hi. We just looked up scheduled maintenance and cabin filter was to be done as part of regular maintenance at 12-24 months. Are they saying they need to replace it again? If it hasn't been done there should not be a cost since they were supposed to already replace it. Also what is Engine Filter. We can't find it in maintenance book schedule. Thanks

Bruce said he heard a clunk when I was parking--turning the wheel to park on hill. Very concerned!! That was a lot of money!!

It's ok to do everything. Let me know when it will be ready. Tomorrow is fine if necessary because my son is out of town
Guess what??
Isn't the car under warranty? Why should there be a fee for any repairs?
Ok what time do you close.?
"Yes, at what time can I leave my car tomorrow?"
Will the car be finished by 7? Can I pick it up then or in the morning?  What would be best?

Thank you for the Feedback Mr. Poplar!-how late may I pick up the car?
When you replace it will it be all original parts ?
That's ok. Thank you for the heads up. Please call or text me when it's ready. 
Thank you for keeping me posted I really appreciate how Toyota takes care of its customers 
I want to cry! I paid 200 something first and you guys said that the problem would be fixed. Then I paid 700 something the second time. Now I either haveto pay 2900 or 886 and risk having it fixed for the 3rd time to end up with the same problem. I mean the problem is the same. What I had done the 1st and2nd time basically was a waste of my money because its still doing the same thing and now you guys want me to keep paying more. That is so unfair. I willbe picking up my car today and not wasting anymore money.
Can you still install an alarm for that and how much just give me the cheapest one
How about today within an hour?
How long will the service take?
What is the service?
What is the service and cost?
"Thank you for your reminder, however I will not be bring my vehicle back to DCH Toyota due to the fact each time I brought it in for an oil change I asked that my tires be rotated.  I was told they were. When I called to ask for the history of my tire rotation for my warranty, they told me they didn't have any record of my tires being rotated. My warrant for my tire was voided and I had to purchase new tire because I could not prove that they had been properly maintain. This left a very negative impact on me with DCH."
"Hi Margaret, what time would you like me to stop by today? "
"Thank you for letting me know my visor is ready. Can I schedule that for today? And if so, how long does it take?"

I will take it and get my car washed somewhere else but I'm extremely disappointed by the poor service here since your technicians are the ones who put the greasy prints on my door panel when I brought it here in January."
At what time your service dept. opens?.
"Awesome go ahead with the alignment, we don't need a rental but please tell me when it'll be done tomorrow when you can. Thank you for the help!"

I arrived at the shop at 3:15 but my car wasn't ready. I asked you to call me if my car wasn't ready by 3. But I didn't hear from you. I was finally told I would have a rental car. By the time I was taken to enterprise, I was already late to work. On top of that I had to pay for the insurance. I will bring you the receipt tomorrow. I am not paying for it. If there's any paperworks you have for me, please have them ready. I will be there at 11:00 and can only stay till 11:30. I cannot be late to work again. Thank you. Kaori Sawada"

"Margaret, I'm not sure what to make of the fact that since I placed the order with you back on December 9th my many attempts to follow up with you through texts have been unanswered and my voicemails have not been returned. I have been patient and positive during this time but when I finally was able to get a hold of you more than a month later I was frustrated to have to remind you about the order and then find out the part was never ordered. Now January is ending and the delays and lack of professionalism are continuing. I can't call this service. I've purchased my last three cars through DCH. It's becoming apparent that Delivering THIS Customer Happiness is of little importance. Shall I move on?"

"Good morning, Chrissy. While my Caravan seems to be running fine without any error codes, I have discovered a small problem.The brake pedal interlock switch for the shifter, which was previously silent, is now clicking loudly when the brake pedal is applied in park. If it's easier, I can simply have my mechanic fix it and bill you.  This would save us both a good deal of inconvenience and another loaner. "

"Don't understand why I would be charged for this. When they took everything apart for the oil recall, I remember you mentioning that everything else had to be inspected to be put back together . This smoke coming out my exhaust was the problem and the Reason y I brought it to be fixed last year. You said it was because of oil leaks. So why am I charged now for something they never corrected . If you recall, I spoke with you shortly after getting my car back and I sent you video of it smoking . This is not new problem . So is Toyota implying that this is new ?"

Que quieres? What you want? 
"Yes. I talked to Clara briefly at the recommendation of Toyota HQ. Was supposed to hear back.  But maybe I'll talk to her at the dealer. I just wanted to make sure that dealer inspections and maintenance were the best thing for me going forward. The customer service is great, but passing previous inspections and missing that one of my brake pads was wearing too quickly has really cost me. I'll see what Clara has to say. You and the staff are all great!"

What does my invoice look like?
I'm not paying any more money. What he did was uncalled good. He was rude and disrespectful and I'd rather do it myself than give any more money to his dealer. Especially after ask the tones I've brought it in and they've done nothing to help me. I've been complaining about this since the first service I brought my car in and they wouldn't even document it.
"Margaret, hope all is well. I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Finals week is pretty crazy and not over yet. This is where we go get the oil changes. Unfortunately they do not keep track of the oil changes that they do, but this is what I have."

Also, I was surprised that labor was $300 on spark plugs when parts are only $70.  Is that normal or is there anything you can do/apply there?  Thanks a lot!  Tony"

"Yes, the technician was very kind in taking the time to explain why the brakes were making the noise. Thank you "
You're the absolute best!!  Thanks again Margaret.  We'll be in early Friday morning with the rental.  Have a great week.  We will see you again when the other recall for the RAV 4 comes in.
Thank you Margaret.  Nick says he can do the brake light bulb himself.  He already made arrangements for the rear brakes to be done by our brake guy in San Pedro when he had the front brakes done last month.  We were just waiting for the engine to be fixed.  Thanks again for taking care of our lady car.  
Quick question...are you guys suppose to replace the gas your techs used? I had about a quarter tank and when I got in I had close to none and my light was on. 
Hi Daniel. The brake pedal sometimes pushes all the way to the floor when I turn the car on. No noise. 
What time do you think
Please Lmk if there will be a charge for checking the seals before your tech performs the service and how much it will be.
One more question...what about the clutch? That one was one of the main reasons I brought my vehicle in. 
The tag you put in my window last time I was there clearly says it's time and when you turn the car on it says time for service
"I'm trying to figure out after you guys called me and told me it was time for my service why you didn't actually do the service ""oil change and stuff"""

So what is the total charge?
How much
"Marvin... first...thanks for working in getting the price for work on my sienna down. THANKS! 2nd...on the Auto Status Report I'm surprised to see anything ""not in the green"". What is ""steering gear box/linkage and boots/ball joints/dust covers""??  Is this report completed as part of the multipoint inspection, which led to the axel replacements? And the description doesn't say anything about axels. So should I be concerned about the steering gear box??Thanks, Sharon Trice"

"Thank you. The printout should be enough. Seem like there are a lot of deals online for express maintenance which includes brake inspired, oil/ filter change,tire rotation, fluid inspection, multi-point inspection. And what im doing today would not be part of the express maintenance?"
Hi Margaret this is Sam Marrufo.   How are you doing ?

"The things I was aware of look a lot better, but the additional work I had no clue about until now which brings the cost back up and honestly I wasn't planning on keeping this car that much longer so probably need to think about trading it in rather than doing all this work. I need to think about it more, can I come in tomorrow to talk to you about it or do you need the car back this evening?"
"Hi Miguel,I'll fill it out when I get to the office tomorrow. Thanks."
"I called Thursday,spoke with a woman, gave her the vin for the car because I had a driver deliver the car and wanted to avoid confusion as to why that car was being dropped off. That wound up happening sat. Instead of fri as planned. I will pick up or have driver come for it. A colossal waste of time and money."
"No,thanks. I am disappointed with the information given to me by the woman I spoke with onThursday. I gave her the full vin and scheduled the car for repair based on her confirmation that it was indeed , quote, covered under a 7 year unlimited mile special warranty. I purchased the car for our company last week based on that information. Now this. Why would she tell me that? You need to answer that question. If it only covered 2009 and older, none would be covered at this point."
OK so how about the brakes if you resurface the rotors with no new pads only with the one we have that are supposed to be good according to you then what would be the cost for that

"Has he checked the other side for that? I just don't want to get led down a path where if I only spend a few thousand more and a few thousand more maybe it will pass next time or the next time. This could get crazy real fast. You know what I mean, Jose?"

"Wow, what a change from the previous Toyota ownership! !  I guess marketing is everything particularly when it comes with quality work......keep up the good work Mark "
Do you know if this is a common issue? My prior car was a Lexus and must have dealt with the actuator problem no less than twice on all 4 doors. I'm worried this will be an ongoing issue. Please make note of this in your records so when my warranty expires I'm not left paying for this issue down the road.
It's ok...please call me when it is ready on Monday.
"Not gonna work...I'll just have to figure something out. I'm a bit confused...this is why I called a week in advance and told you the issue, you said it would be no problem. That if you didn't have the part you could order it and have it ready on Saturday for sure. What happened all day today?"

So what happened to the other side...? it was fine when I brought it in.
So what happened to the other side...? it was fine when I brought it in.
Hold on please. You said $149 for work on the breaks. Why is the bill coming to $238?
"Also how much is it looking so far for an estimate, price-wise?"
Ah OK. At the front desk I thought they had said 7... What should I do?
"Hi Margaret, argh I won't be able to make it there by 5 PM... What should I do? I'm not able to talk on the phone right now either"
Hi Jos . Just checking in to see how my truck is doing.
How is my ride coming along?
Hi Margaret was wondering around what time my car would be ready thanks 
Please contact me when ready. Thank you
"Thank you!! Regarding the front struts and them leaking, they've been doing that for a long time now - I had pointed that out before when I've come in for service and was still under Toyota care. I don't know why those weren't fixed then or I didn't get an estimate for those before? "

What time do you close?

How r we doin w finishing up today
Can I have an update on how much longer?
"If you recall this morning I had asked you to contact me by email since I don't have access to my phone at work. I checked my email all day and received nothing. I realized at 5:45 I wasn't going to hear from you and left work to go out to the car, checked my phone and made the payment.  I then left work early to make sure I made it by 9pm for pick up. I'm sure you can imagine how thrilled I was to get all the way down there to find the keys were not with sales. So now I will be late going to work tomorrow because I have to wait until 7:30 to get the car."
Thx.  I'll pay with check when I arrive...
Is there a shuttle coming to get me when my car is ready?
"If I don't repair those items, what would happen? And what causes those problems?"
"Okay, I'm tied up most of today. How late are you open?"
It sounds like a lot but I think each is important. Go ahead with all. I am curious on how the hybrid battery filter  can be so dirty at this point? And if I can do anything to avoid that. Also another question.  Most if not all the time I will run the ac on recirculate. Is that more of a problem for the ac evaporator?
Not very happy. Went on vacation and parked my car in our driveway while we were gone. This is what we came home to. A huge oil stain!
What is the latest I can pick it up?
That's great! How late are you open?
"In a meeting, I'll call you when done in about an hour"
The check engine light that you mentioned - you said it will be reset but don't know what will come back clear or not. Please keep me posted. Thanks again. 
What was the problem?  
When will the car be ready for p/u?

Was the rental company informed of this change? I don't mind keeping the rental for another day but I don't understand why it takes so long to get a set of tires.
I haven't been content with you guys at dch ever. Since the day I bought the car it's been a mess with you guys . Even your guys own mechanic walked out n said dang they still got you here?. You guys always say one thing n do another . It's never been anything on our part either it's always been your guys mistakes. Like come on one time I understand but ever time we come in there it's something. So what can you do ? What's in your power ??? There's no point of us texting back n forth if it ain't much you can do ?

I tried looking for the power steering fluid under the hood but can't find it. I checked the tires and nothing was under inflated as well. So I don't know if it's related to the work last time."

Ok I am also hearing a clunk when I turn the steering wheel - maybe they can check it out
Hi. Yes I was not sure since there was not instructions. I asked the girl at the counter and she had no idea what is was. So I just assumed they skipped the last step as it was late on Saturday. I though about trying to do it myself but I did not know if there was a special procedure. I read the bottle and it stated to do so into the intake. So I decided to ask the counter. She recommended we just send you a message since she had nobody around to ask. I would like to use it since the odor was pretty bad at its worse. It's better now but I keep thinking I smell a little from time to time. So maybe doing that last step will mask whatever smell is left. Can I come by next Saturday morning? I assume it's a fast thing.
"HI, Ms AmyCould you check my car status which is 2015 sienna red color. Thanks."

I was trying to get some information on my daughters Toyota Prius regarding her windshield and the type of windshield that she has because it needs to be replaced. The replacement facility told me there are two types of windshields for her model car. One standard and one that is hooked up to an alert system. I was hoping if I could give you her Vin number if you could look up which windshield her particular car model has. Is this something you could do

Yesterday you said no problem when I asked you if you have checked  defrosting part of front window. This morning I attepted to defrost around 5:30am for 6 minutes. Rear window got defrosted except top and bottom portions of it but front window was not defrosted at all.
How can this happen when they have maybe put maybe 150 -200 miles since they bought it used.  That should have been through a full inspection before Toyota sold it.
